"Why countries have different voltage"
Countries have different voltage systems mainly due to historical and technical reasons, as well as differences in national standards and regulations. The choice of voltage can be influenced by factors such as the size of the country, the availability and cost of resources, and the level of industrialization. Different voltages also require different types of electrical infrastructure, which can be expensive to change once established. Therefore, it is often easier and more practical for countries to stick with their existing voltage systems rather than switch to a different one.
