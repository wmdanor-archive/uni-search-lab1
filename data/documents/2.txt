"Why countries have different currencies"
Countries have different currencies because each country has its own government, economy, and financial system. Currencies are used as a medium of exchange for goods and services within a country and in international trade. Different currencies allow countries to have control over their monetary policy, such as adjusting interest rates and printing money.
